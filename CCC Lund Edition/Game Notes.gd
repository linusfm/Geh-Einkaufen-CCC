### Ideas for Games

#Mgame 8: A cat fight where both cats shoot lasers from their eyes. The player hast to hit space multiple times at the correct time, to win the battle. Every time space is hit, the beam crush moves towards the enemy cat
#Mgame 9: A cat writing a speech. The player needs to hit 3-5 correct input actions. A cat is typing Meow Meow Meow on a paper on every correct action

### Main Game
# First all games play in sequence. Once all games are completed, random mode starts, where all games spawn randomly
